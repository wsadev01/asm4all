# Assembler for all

This is my first project on github, i created this repository with the objective of become a contributor of the assembler
programming community, regardless its architecture, i mainly choose github for the following two reasons.

  *1) It is free.*  
  *2) Anyone can bring useful information and snippet code, answers, **etc.***
  
  ------------------
  
## Folders

The content wil be splitted in five; `books` `links` `snippets` `challenges` & `utils`  
And then will be subdivided by architecture and if you can, by operative system (if there are OS oriented)

    
**i.e**  
*`asm4all/snippets/x64_0-helloworld.asm`*  
*`asm4all/books/i386/foobar.pdf`*  
*`asm4all/books/i386/linux/foo.epub`*
