# Assembler for all

This is my first project on github, i created this repository with the objective of become a contributor of the assembler
programming community, regardless its architecture, i mainly choose github for the following two reasons.

  *1) It is free.*  
  *2) Anyone can bring useful information and snippet code, answers, **etc.***
  
  ------------------
  
## Folders

The content wil be splitted in four; `projects` `books` `links` `snippets` & `challenges`
And then will be subdivided by architecture:
    
**i.e: `asm/snippets/i386/`**
  
There is no need to explaint what the folders content are, they are self-descriptive.  
Tho i will put a little text on each one.
